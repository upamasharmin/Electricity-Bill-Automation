# Electricity-Bill-Automation
Robi Electricity Billing Automation
I have developed the automation part of the Robi Electricity Billing/E Bill. Done by raw Python coding and inputs are collected from our shared source SharePoint.Before this development, the billing team needed a manpower hour of about 3-4 business days for gathering bills from vendors and calculating and circulating them. With the help of this automation, now it is done within 8 minutes. This is my project from EDOTCO Bangladesh as a developer of the Robi Billing Automation Team.
